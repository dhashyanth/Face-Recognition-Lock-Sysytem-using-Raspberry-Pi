# Face-Recognition-Lock-Sysytem-using-Raspberry-Pi
The Face Recognition-based Door Lock System is a project that utilizes OpenCV, a computer vision library, to develop a secure and convenient access control mechanism. By integrating a camera and facial recognition algorithms, the system captures and analyzes facial features, allowing authorized individuals to gain access. This project aims to provide a robust and reliable solution for door security, eliminating the need for physical keys or passwords. With a focus on accuracy and efficiency, it offers a seamless user experience while ensuring enhanced security measures
